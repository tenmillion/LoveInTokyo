Aash helps Gachida-sensei with his power-saving campaign, and also starts up an "English greeting" campaign of her own.
Gachida-sensei takes a liking to her and invites her and Laura-sensei to see his band, P's, perform in front of Machida station.
Aash is disgusted with Gachida-sensei's mediocrity but tells herself that her acting pursuit was not any better.

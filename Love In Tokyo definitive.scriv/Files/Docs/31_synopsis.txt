In a Punjabi town.
A 14-year-old Suji(played by his “younger brother” Sandeep) comes into a newly opened Internet café, hoping to do research for a school project on Japan. He accidentally comes across an American website describing the Shibuya-kei movement.
A contrarian, he has been looking for something that will give him an edge over the mainstream counterculture popular among the cool kids at school. He senses that an obscure (at least in his town) Japanese counterculture is fit for the purpose.
He is fascinated by contemporary acts such as Pizzicato Five and Cornelius. Through them, he soon discovers Jean-Luc Godard and gets into filmmaking.

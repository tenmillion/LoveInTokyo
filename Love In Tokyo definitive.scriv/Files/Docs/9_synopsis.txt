「僕はこんな映画撮りたくなかったんだけど...」

An aspiring 23-year-old filmmaker originally from rural Punjab and now studying film in Delhi.
Has come to Tokyo to shoot his final project, a short documentary on Shibuya-kei culture.
As a teen, he had read about the Shibuya-kei movement at an Internet café in his hometown, and has been infatuated with it ever since.
Considers himself part of Delhi’s indie film scene and scorns mainstream Bollywood film, though he is well versed in its classics.
Aloof and sarcastic, but can be a nice guy when he feels like it (mostly around women he likes). 
Has liberal views but is also fiercely proud of his Sikh tradition. His friends marvel at his ever-tasteful turbans.

[Song: “Monk Song” by Yoritam]

Noa performs his signature song, singing about the futility of his love life and his wish to become a monk.

On the way to the venue, Hirari had told Aash about Noa: how they met in the economics department in Todai; how he was interested in working for developing countries; how he one day got hooked on Indonesian music and dropped out to pursue music; how he comes from a temple and always talked about becoming a monk one day; how his friends ridiculed him about this because of his ways with women.

Hirari’s narration and Noa’s performance are illustrated by dance sequences that are also flashbacks of Noa's colorful past.

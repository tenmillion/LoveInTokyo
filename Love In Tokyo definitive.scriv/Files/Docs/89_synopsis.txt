In an attempt to take the movie back into his own hands, Suji includes Aash's Shibuya crossing sequence in the movie. They shoot it on their 60s Tokyo set, but the filming is cut short by members of an enemy mafia group barging in. The set is ruined, and Suji is forced to scrap the scene.

Suji confides his frustration to Bahar, saying that the movie is turning into something he did not mean to create. Bahar apologizes that she has not been able to stop Srikanth. She sees comedy in their situation and jokes that they can make a movie about this movie in the future.

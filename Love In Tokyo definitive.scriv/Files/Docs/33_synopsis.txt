2010.
Aash recollects her last summer vacation as a college student â€“ her last attempt at Bollywood, she had told herself.
She has come to a studio somewhere in Mumbai, and is sitting in front of a movie casting director, reciting some lines in Hindi, auditioning for a small role.
Her acting is quite good, but the director is not looking for an East Asian actress with an accent. She waves Aash away.

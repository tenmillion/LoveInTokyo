[Song: “Punjab, Setagaya” by Yoritam] 

Suji and Bahar chill out on the back of a small truck in Setagaya, like they used to do in Punjab.
The tiny paddy fields are brimming with yellow, ripe ears of rice, and a cool breeze signals the approaching autumn as the Punjabi tune rings out over the scene in a Fishmans-style dub.
Suji hugs Bahar and tells her that he is happy to be working with her on a film again. Bahar seems uneasy and embarrassed. They go back into bro mode.

[Song: “Mera Joota Hai Japani” by Mukesh – Russian folk version]

Aash takes him to a local Russian song café for dinner, run by middle-aged leftists.
The couple is delighted when the singers start singing this Hindi song for Suji, in their distinct Russian folk singing style. They both sing along and have a good time.

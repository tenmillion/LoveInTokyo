Suji and his crew come to Tokyo for one month to film their location scenes while parts of their set are being rebuilt in Mumbai. The movie has turned into a vertitable C-grade masala movie, to Suji's horror.

Suji takes the crew to an onsen in Odaiba. 
At the onsen, Srikanth is refused entry because of his snake tattoos.
Mr. Gupta thinks he is hit on by an old Japanese man who looks like the actor/bassist Ittoku Kishibe. He pounces on him, only to find that the guy was just being unusually nice.
In Srikanth's absence, Meghumi flirts with Suji, to his annoyance.
Some sexual tension is felt between Suji and Bahar, but they ignore it.

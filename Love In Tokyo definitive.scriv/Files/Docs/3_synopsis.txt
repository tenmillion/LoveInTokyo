Suji and Bahar get in touch with Aash.
Suji and Aash meet again in Machida.
Suji proposes to make a movie together. Aash agrees.

[Song: “Tsuzuki wo” by Salyu – Japanese/Hindi version, Supermarket Mix]

She then breaks into song, first in Japanese and then in Hindi, and dances with a stick figure in the streets and supermarket aisles of Machida. At last, her reality is becoming film, and film is becoming her reality. Toward the end of the song, Suji climbs into his place alongside her and replaces the stick figure. Bahar and Noa appear from somewhere and join in the dance.

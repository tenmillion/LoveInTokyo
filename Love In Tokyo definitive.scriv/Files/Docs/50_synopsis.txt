Early April, 2012. After an unsuccessful job hunt, Aash has repeated a year in college and managed to find a job at a local middle school as an English teacher. She is starting her new job this month.

For more than a year, she has been trying to forget Suji, but hasn't been able to. She has refrained from visiting most of the places she showed Suji around, but she still manages to be reminded of him by the most random things - a miniature painting of a Mughal prince (who she thinks resembles Suji) that she finds in a middle school history textbook at her new job, for instance.

Fundamentally, her lingering feelings for Suji also reflect how she has not been able to completely give up on her dreams. She feels that maybe, just maybe, if she gets in touch with Suji, he would help her find a role in a Hindi movie and make her dreams come true.

The soundtrack lacks music, reflecting a lack of captivating narrative in her current life. Instead, she hears in the wind, in the school chimes, the train announcements, echoes of the Tokyo song she danced to with Suji. (The idea is that she had bits of the song somehow playing in her head while she was with him)

Aash gets to know her colleagues. Gachida-sensei is an overzealous "reformer" who is constantly trying to start up (mostly insignificant) new campaigns at the school. His latest project is this summer's power-saving campaign. 

The other female teachers are always holding birthday parties for each other and bringing fashionable confectionery to the office, and Aash feels uncomfortably pressured to do the same.
The only tolerable colleague is Laura-sensei, who is an assistant English teacher from Britain. Her tastes are too Japanese for Aash, however.

Aash's interactions with her colleagues remain superficial throughout the movie. Aash never tells them about Suji, or the fact that she had tried to become an actress before becoming a teacher.

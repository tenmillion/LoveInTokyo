[Song: “Tokyo” by Yoritam – First verse]

Aash is waiting for the train at the Odakyu Machida station, with her “recruit suit” still on. She has missed Indian culture during her job hunt, and is excited to go back, for a day. A recorded voice announcing the station name – “Machida, Machida” – fades into the chorus of the song.

[Song 2: “Tokyo” by Yoritam – Third verse]

Aash and Suji part at Odakyu Shinjuku station before her last train home. Suji has to catch a plane the next morning. Suji says he would just walk back to his hostel to enjoy the cold night air.
They dance together at the station, just outside the ticket gates, this time involving many people. Suji always dances with a sophisticated look of disinterest.

They agree not to see each other again. (Aash is adamant on giving up her interest in cinema, and there is no realistic way they can be together. It would be hard for Aash to find a job in India, and for Suji to find a job in Japan. It would be better to preserve the good memory of their time together, unchanged. Suji is sad because he thinks she is being overly pessimistic, but decides to respect her decision. He himself does not really believe that she would make it as an actress in India, and their relationship would not really work otherwise.) 
Suji tells her he would never forget her, and that she can always get in touch with him again should she ever change her mind - she can just google his name. Aash breaks into tears and says she has to forget him, otherwise she wouldn't be able to move on. They squeeze each other for a moment before she hurries off through a ticket gate. (The train is a local, though, and her tears dry out before she reaches Machida – as sung in the chorus of “Tokyo”)

[Song 9: “Onna no Odyssey” by Yoritam] 

Aash is watching NHK in the living room on a Sunday afternoon with her parents, when Nodo-Jiman comes on and a young Japanese female enka enthusiast starts singing in a kimono. The screen then switches to the singer changing costume and performing gratuitous, suggestive dancing surrounded by a group of attractive men playing various musical instruments, in the manner of an “item number”(a suggestive dance sequence unrelated to the main plot of the movie).
The song, about echoes of a passionate romance threatening to lead a woman astray, resonates with Aash. This is expressed on screen by Aash getting involved in the suggestive dancing with the singer. (The dancing is interrupted by chimes – the singer gets a rating of two) Aash decides that she should not let memories of Suji and the faint hopes of starting a Bollywood career keep her from concentrating on her new job. She resolves to start up a new project with Gachida-sensei, in order to get into her job more.

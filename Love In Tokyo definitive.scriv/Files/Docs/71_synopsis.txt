Their filming is off to a bad start when Srikanth insists that the story be set in 1952 instead because he wants his character to ride a cable car in Shibuya(the Hibari) that only existed then. He tries to have the entire set rebuilt to be based on 50s Tokyo. They come to a compromise by preserving the set, and taking creative license to have the Hibari exist in the 60s.

Meghumi arrives on scene from Japan. She refuses to eat any Indian food and demands that udon be delivered to her room every day. She is always complaining about the udon being too soft and the soup too salty. She is a terrible actress, and everyone except Srikanth quickly grows to hate her. She occasionally disappears to do something on her own, but Srikanth never challenges her about it, saying she needs her "me-time".

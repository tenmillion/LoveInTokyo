Srikanth insists that the movie be turned into a masala musical. He hires musicians to write and perform the songs without Suji's consent.
Suji has no choice but to include the songs. Meghumi is even bad at lip-syncing.

As an attempt to take the movie back into his own hands, Suji includes Aash's Shibuya crossing sequence in the movie. They shoot it on their 60s Tokyo set, but the filming is cut short by members of an enemy mafia group barging in. The set is ruined, and Suji is forced to scrap the scene.

Suji confides his frustration to Bahar, saying that the movie is turning into something he did not mean to create. Bahar apologizes that she has not been able to stop Srikanth. She points out that "it's a pretty funny story when you think about it" and jokes that they can make a movie about this movie in the future.

[Song: “Tokyo Ren-ai Senka, Matawa Koi Wa Itte Mirya Bodi Buro” by Kenji Ozawa]

Next morning. The song is still playing.
Suji and Aash are sightseeing together. They are in love. They both realize that their tastes and interests are actually quite different, perhaps incompatible, but this only adds to their mutual attraction.
Aash takes Suji to places around Tokyo with many foreigners and shops catering to them – Ueno, Ikebukuro, Takadanobaba, Shin-Okubo, Roppongi – the places she loves most in Tokyo, places where she can feel like she is outside Japan.
Occasional gratuitous dancing.

Suji asks Aash what she would be doing the following Monday. She says she has another job interview.
She is revealed to have been feeling pessimistic about life in general due to by her failure to become a Bollywood actress. None of the jobs available sounds very exciting to her, and the job hunt has been extremely painful.
But she feels that she has to get a stable, normal job. She was never very persistent at anything before deciding to aim at a Bollywood career, and now that that dream is lost, she again feels like she has nothing at her core. She is desperate to prove to herself and to her family that she can at least get a decent job in Japan and stick to it.
Suji tells her that she doesn't have to take the job hunt so seriously. She is talented, and still young, so she should keep trying to find outlets for her talent, even if they are not necessarily in India. But she does not seem to understand.
She asks him what he would do when he goes back to India. He tells her that he would first graduate, then he would keep doing odd film jobs like he has done for a long time. He is confident that he can get by in the industry somehow, even if he does not become very famous or rich. Aash envies him, not realizing that she is preventing herself from being in a similar position, by being unflexible.

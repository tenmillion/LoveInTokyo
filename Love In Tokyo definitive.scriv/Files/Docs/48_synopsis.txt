Suji asks Aash what she would be doing the following Monday. She says she has another job interview.

Aash is desperate to prove to herself and to her family that she can actually support herself.

Suji tells her that she doesn't have to take the job hunt so seriously. She is talented, and still young, so she should keep trying to find creative outlets for her talent, even if they are not necessarily in India, or involve full-time acting jobs.

Aash does not seem to understand.

She asks him what he would do when he goes back to India. He tells her that he would first graduate, then he would keep doing odd film jobs like he has done for a long time. He is confident that he can get by in the industry somehow, even if he does not become very famous or rich. Aash envies him, not realizing that her own pessimism and inflexibility are preventing herself from having a similar outlook on life.

Noa leaves for his one-year monk training in Koyasan. Before leaving, he invites Aash to his bar and plays a new song he has made for her.
Aash decides to keep choreographing Bollywood dance sequences in Tokyo as a side job. She has started a Bollywood dancing club in her middle school, and it has quickly become popular among some students.

Suji's crew is once again in Tokyo to film their cherry blossom sequence. They have come a bit early, as they heard that the cherry blossoms were going to be early this year.

While the filming is not yet finished, Meghumi suddenly announces that she is leaving for Koyasan to become a nun. It is revealed that she had been Noa's stalker. Srikanth pursues her to Koyasan, then stops funding the movie after realizing that he cannot persuade her to come back. Meghumi mysteriously disappears during her nun training, never to return. The movie is scrapped.

Suji is disheartened, but Bahar still wants to keep making a movie with him. She urges Suji to make a movie based on their story, with Aash acting and choreographing.

They get in touch with Aash. Suji and Aash meet again in Machida. Suji proposes to make a movie together. Aash agrees.

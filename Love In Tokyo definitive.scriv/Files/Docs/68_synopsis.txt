The filming has finished, and the crew has begun editing. Srikanth decides to add a cherry blossom scene on a whim, and schedules another location shoot in the coming spring. The movie has by now been completely hijacked by Srikanth.
Aash's video has gone viral on YouTube. Mr. Gupta finds it and shows it to the entire crew at Suji's birthday party. Suji is happy to know that Aash has found a creative outlet, and wryly remarks that now he is the one who is frustrated with an unsatisfactory job.
Bahar's jealousy finally crosses threshold, and she lets it out by smashing Suji's birthday cake on his face and storming out of the party.
Suji realizes that Bahar has been in love with him all along. Suji acknowledges his own feelings for her, and Bahar comes to terms with her sexuality. They start dating.

Meghumiにゾッコンなムンバイマフィアの若きリーダー．ハイデラバードのスラムで育つ．30代後半のジャイアンみたいな体格に，ゴーギャンに似せた口髭を生やしている．残忍な性格で「蛇」と恐れられるが，変にロマンチスト．

A prominent member of the Mumbai underworld, in his late 30s.
Grew up in the slums of Hyderabad, then came to Mumbai and made a fortune there through all manners of shady dealings. 
Looks big and menacing. Wears a moustache like Paul Gauguin and half-seriously considers himself his reincarnate.
In love with Meghumi, a 19-year-old Japanese girl.
Finds Suji’s screenplay in the trash and hires him to direct it, with himself and Meghumi in the lead roles.

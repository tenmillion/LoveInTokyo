B'zのアコースティックカバーバンドP'sとして地元町田の路上で精力的に活動する30代前半男性社会科教諭．小柄で筋肉質．ブラック精神満載でちょっと暑苦しく，生徒にも馬鹿にされているがいつも朗らか．吾須理の熱意(?)を気に入って，やたらと構ってくる．

Aash’s annoying colleague at school.
Constantly tries to launch new campaigns at his school, most of them highly insignificant.
Plays in an amateur band called P’s, an acoustic cover band of B’z.
Believes in working hard and playing hard, to a fault.
Ridiculed by his colleagues and students, but still loves them.

[Song: “A Message Song” by Pizzicato Five]

Time-lapse image of his room being gradually filled with Shibuya-kei paraphernalia and records. Brief footages of him and Bahar shooting experimental films together and riding trucks.

Suji is soon in high school. He drives through his family’s fields in a truck, while listening to the dubbed P5 song on his car stereo. Bahar is gone. He still thinks about her. The song seems to be a message from him to her. He loved her - as his best friend, though he never had any romantic feelings for her.
A brief pause when Suji tries to play the song with a local band. They transform it into a Punjabi version. "Ah, forget it." Suji storms out of the studio and the original song resumes.

Suji is shown going to Delhi after high school to study filmmaking. 

Other characters dance through the scenes in an overlay kind of fashion. A bit like in an anime opening sequence, with a flurry of characters.

When the song ends, it is November 2011 and Suji is in Tokyo shooting his final project, a documentary on the Shibuya-kei movement.

They end the day by going to a Jean Luc Godard-themed bar in Golden Gai, Shinjuku.
They talk about Suji's life. Suji is a good storyteller, vividly recounting episodes from his frustrated youth as a lonely Japanophile in a Punjabi village. Aash is completely taken with Suji and the stories he tells.
He then starts to recall episodes with Bahar, his best friend in middle school whom he has not heard from since.

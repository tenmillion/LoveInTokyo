Aash has not been able to forget Suji like she had sworn to. She is also still haunted by her dreams of Bollywood.
Aash starts working at a local middle school as an English teacher. Aash's colleagues are introduced. Gachida-sensei is an overzealous "reformer" who is constantly trying to start up new campaigns at the school. His latest project is this summer's power-saving campaign.
Laura-sensei is a stereotypical gaijin Japanophile and Aash's only tolerable colleague.
Aash resolves to start up her own campaign with Gachida-sensei, hoping it would help her forget her past.

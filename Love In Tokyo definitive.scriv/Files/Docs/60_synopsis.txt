[Song: "Indo Jin Mo Bikkuri" by Yoritam]

Srikanth, a gang leader in Mumbai, comes across the discarded printout while he is walking down the street with his aides.
His curiosity is piqued by the thick bundle of paper, and he orders his aides to take it out and clean it for him to read.

Srikanth reads Suji's screenplay, and thoroughly identifies with the protagonist - he has a young lover in Tokyo whose wish to become an actress he has always wanted to help realize. Srikanth also considers himself an artist(his role model is Gauguin), and has wanted to try his hand at acting. Srikanth tracks Suji down(the script had his name on it).
Suji is making an omelet for breakfast (with a toothbrush in his mouth) in his apartment in Delhi when Srikanth knocks on his door.

On finding that he is also a film director, Srikanth talks Suji into directing the film. Suji agrees, though not completely happy with his script. He is attracted by the paycheck offered by Srikanth and the prospect of being able to film on location in Tokyo.

He also harbors faint hopes of seeing Aash again, though he has been discouraged by his previous failed attempts to find her online.

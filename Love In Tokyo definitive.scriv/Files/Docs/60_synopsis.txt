Srikanth, a prominent member of a gang in Mumbai, comes across the discarded printout while he is walking down the street with his aides.
His curiosity is piqued by the thick bundle of paper, and he orders his aides to take it out and clean it for him to read.

Srikanth reads Suji's screenplay, and thoroughly identifies with the protagonist - there is a girl in Tokyo he cannot forget, whose dreams of being an actress he has always wanted to support. Srikanth also considers himself an artist(his role model is Gauguin), and has wanted to try his hands at acting.
Srikanth tracks Suji down(the script had his name on it), and on finding that he is also a film director, talks him into directing the film. Suji agrees, though not completely happy with his script. He is attracted by the paycheck offered by Srikanth and the prospect of being able to film on location in Tokyo. He also harbors faint hopes of seeing Aash again, though he has been discouraged by his failed attempts to find her online, and thinks that she probably really wanted to forget him.

[Song: “Sendagi/Zindagi” by Yoritam]

Aash arrives in Sendagi. She is suddenly dressed in a colorful Punjabi suit.
She dances to the song (the song has nonsensical lyrics that have meanings in both Hindi and Japanese), involving the restaurant’s staff and customers, and passers-by.

Enters Suji, who happens to have gotten off at Sendagi and stopped by for lunch.
He is impressed by Aash's dancing and starts talking to her in a broken Japanese. Aash answers in fluent (albeit accented) Hindi, mixing in some Punjabi, and he is even more impressed.
Aash is intrigued when she finds out Suji is studying film. She asks him to wait till lunch time is over, then she would show him around Sendagi.

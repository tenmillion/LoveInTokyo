[Song: “Nihon Indo-ka Keikaku” by Kinniku Shojo Tai (brief excerpt)]

Aash and Suji hit a karaoke after dinner. Suji shows off his knowledge of Japanese songs, to Aash’s amusement.

Aash then stops the music and starts singing a romantic Bollywood classic a capella (because the song is not in the karaoke). 

[Song: ??? undecided (Brief excerpt)]

Suji joins in. They sing together, looking into each other’s eyes.

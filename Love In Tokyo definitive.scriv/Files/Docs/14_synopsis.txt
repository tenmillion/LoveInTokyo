[Song: “Tokyo” by Yoritam – full Bollywood mix]

Director, screenplay, Suji: Suraj Singh
Choreography, screenplay, Aash: Aashree Kanada
Producer: Bahar Bahri
Music: Noa Saeki
Key grip: Sanjay Gupta


A full-on dance sequence, shot throughout Tokyo during the cherry blossom season.  The “real” characters even shake hands with the “actors.” (Just for fun)

“Making-of” scenes which also suggest what happened to the characters later are occasionally inserted:
Bahar, Suji and Aash pitch their movie to Bollywood, and capitalizing on their publicity, manage to get funding for it(it is the movie itself).
Suji compromises on the film’s artsiness, but is still happy that he gets to use some of his favorite Shibuya-kei songs.
Suji and Aash maintain a professional yet friendly relationship.
Suji is engaged to Bahar.
Noa comes back from his training in Koyasan, and now holds music events at his temple. He happily agrees to provide songs for the soundtrack.

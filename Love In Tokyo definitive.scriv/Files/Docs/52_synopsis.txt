(Suji has now graduated from college, and is freelancing in Delhi. He is still having to do mostly random work to sustain himself.
True to his words, he has not forgotten his feelings for Aash. As a filmmaker, he likes a good story, and his story with Aash was too dramatic to forget. He has been thinking about how he can turn it into a movie.
Though he does not really expect to see her again, and definitely not to date her, he still vaguely hopes that she would change her mind about him and contact him, maybe even visit him on holiday. He cannot get very serious about dating other women, because this is still always at the back of his mind somewhere.)

Suji has been writing a screenplay based on his and Aash's story, but set in the 1960s. (The story reflects what Suji wants to have happened - they never see each other again, but Aash fulfills her dreams of becoming an actress)
It is about a married Indian politician who visits Tokyo for a meeting, and a Japanese starlet who is working at a hostess bar. They fall in love, and the politician invites the girl to come to live in India with him as a "concubine." The girl refuses, saying that she still needs to help support her poor family.
The politician pays off her family's debt, and their affair becomes a minor scandal. The girl does not want to go to India, however, and chooses to stay in Tokyo. She goes on to fulfill her dreams of becoming a star, using the publicity gained through the scandal to her advantage.

Suji finishes the screenplay. He takes a printout with him and reads it over and over again.
After a while, however, he starts to feel unhappy with it. He thinks that maybe he is still too young to start making movies about his own life. He is in Mumbai for a music video shoot when he decides to scrap the screenplay. He discards his printout in a public wastebasket and moves on with his life.

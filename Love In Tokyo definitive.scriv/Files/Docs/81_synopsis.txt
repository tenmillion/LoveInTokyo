[Song: “Tokyo” by Yoritam – Many Sides of Tokyo Mix]

Aash and Noa film the music video at the Shibuya crossing. Noa has called on his many Twitter buddies to appear in their video, and they have been filming in various parts of Tokyo with them earlier the same night.
The end product is a showcase of the many different subcultures of Tokyo, each with their own group dance and a part of the track to go with it.
Noa anonymously stands in for "Suji" in a black body suit that is painted to make him look like a stick figure.
They edit the video and upload it on YouTube. Aash hesitates to email Suji about it, but openly dedicates the video to him.

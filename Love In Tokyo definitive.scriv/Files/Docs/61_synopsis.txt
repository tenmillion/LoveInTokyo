Suji meets Bahar while putting together a film crew. She has returned from Canada after getting an engineering degree there, and has been working in Bollywood as a lighting engineer.

Bahar's character is fleshed out. She is professional and capable, though relaxed about her work and life in general. Her masculine demeanor has not changed since middle school. She finds that she still has a soft spot for Suji, but still feels uncomfortable about letting it show. She really wants to work with Suji on a film again, and suggests that he commission her company to handle the equipment. Suji agrees.
 
Bahar introduces Suji to her boss, Mr. Gupta, who grew up in Los Angeles and was trained in Hollywood. Together they are hired by Srikanth to run the grip department in his film.

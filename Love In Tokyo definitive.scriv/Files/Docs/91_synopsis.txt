After the festival, Noa invites Aash and Hirari for a coffee at a nearby live music bar he works at. 

Aash is quickly smitten by Noa's charms. He is easy to talk to, and Aash ends up recounting her episode with Suji to him, as well as humming the tune that has been playing in her head. Noa takes great interest in this episode.

Noa goes to the piano in the café and starts playing Boneka Dari India, an Indonesian oldie which is actually a copy of an older Hindi song from a Bollywood movie. 

[Song: “Boneka Dari India/Sama Hai Bahar Ka” by Lata Mangeshkar]

Aash sings the original song in Hindi. Noa tells her that this was the song that first got him hooked on Indonesian music. 
Noa likes her voice, and offers to make a track for her tune. Aash is thrilled.

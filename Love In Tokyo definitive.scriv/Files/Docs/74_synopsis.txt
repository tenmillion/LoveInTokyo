[Song: "Ultra Soul" by B'z - Unplugged by P's]

Gachida-sensei takes a liking to Aash and invites her and Laura-sensei to see his band, P's, perform in front of Machida station.
Aash is disgusted with Gachida-sensei's mediocrity but tells herself that her acting pursuit was not any better.
As she listens to P's perform, she "hears" the Tokyo chorus again in a street vendor's calls. P's's song is cut short.

スージーの中学時代の親友．二人でSquare Bullshit Entertainmentというユニット名で映画を撮っていた．紆余曲折を経て，今はボリウッドで映画専門の電気技師．昔からスージーのことが好きだが，中性的というか男っぽいキャラなので言えないでいる．

A 26-year-old lighting engineer and Suji’s best friend in middle school. She and Suji made movies together under the name "Square Bullshit Entertainment".
Had a major crush on Suji but never let it show.
Left her conservative Muslim parents in Punjab after middle school to live with her more liberal relatives in Alberta, Canada. Still retains her faith but has cut ties with her parents.
Has returned to India after graduating from a Canadian university, and has been working in Bollywood. Is later hired to be the best boy grip in Suji’s film crew. 
Has secretly been trying to reconcile her sexuality with her otherwise asexual/masculine personality, but has yet to find a satisfactory balance.

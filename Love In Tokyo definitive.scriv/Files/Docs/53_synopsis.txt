Suji and Aash meet in Tokyo. Aash shows Suji a facet of Tokyo he hadn't seen before. They fall in love.
Suji tries to convince Aash to continue her acting career in Japan, but Aash wouldn’t do it if it’s not in Bollywood.
Aash wants to find a stable job in Japan instead, and prove to her parents that she is capable of doing something other than dreaming about Bollywood.
Suji hopes to eventually live in Tokyo, but does not expect to find a job here anytime soon. 
After a perfect romantic weekend, they part ways without promising to meet again.

Aash shows Suji some old temples and buildings in the area.
The two walk around Todai. Aash talks about her older sister who graduated from there and now works at a prestigious consulting firm; about giving up her dreams of becoming an actress in Bollywood; about how bad she feels when she compares herself to her sister.
Suji tells her that she can be proud as long as she stays true to what she loves, and that nothing stops her from working with film as a hobby – not even funding is a major concern these days. Suji likes Aash, so he is nice to her. He is not his usual sarcastic self.
Aash then tells him about her dream – to star in a Bollywood movie, featuring a full-scale group dance sequence in the Shibuya crossing. Suji says, jokingly, that they can make that movie together.

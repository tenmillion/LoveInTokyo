Suji's crew throw him a surprise birthday party.
Aash's video has gone viral on YouTube. Mr. Gupta finds it and shows it to the entire crew at Suji's birthday party. Suji is happy to know that Aash has found a creative outlet, and wryly remarks that now he is the one who is frustrated with an unsatisfactory job.
Bahar's jealousy finally crosses threshold, and she lets it out by smashing Suji's birthday cake on his face and storming out of the party.

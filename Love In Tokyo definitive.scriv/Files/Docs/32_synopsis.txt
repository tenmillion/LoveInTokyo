Suji was her Kenji Ozawa, and Bahar was his Keigo Oyamada. They had both been outcasts since elementary school. Bahar
was a mischievous tomboy, nicknamed Bandar(monkey), always
climbing things and pulling pranks on others. Suji was
physically weak and his popular classmates gave him a hard time.
In middle school Suji discovers Shibuya-kei culture on the
Internet, and gets into filmmaking. His way of one-upping the
cool kids was to have obscure cultural knowledge that they didn't. One day he asks Bahar to help him shoot a scene. Bahar enjoys
it. They have a similar sarcastic sense of humor, and they soon
become best friends. They start up a "film production" named
Square Bullshit Entertainment (in reference to their initials BB
and SS, inspired by Kenji Ozawa and Keigo Oyamada's Double
Knockout Corporation) and make short movies together. Bahar
develops a major crush on him, but cannot let it show for fear
of breaking out of her masculine character that she is otherwise
completely comfortable with.
The fun times don't last long. Bahar's conservative parents
soon want her to start behaving like a girl. Bahar gets upset
and goes off to Canada to live with her more liberal relatives.
Suji stays in Punjab and continues to shoot his own films,
and by the end of high school he has earned respect from his
classmates.

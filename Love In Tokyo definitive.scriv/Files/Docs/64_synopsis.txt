[Young, Alive, in Love - Flipper's Guitar]

Suji finds that he and Bahar still get along very well. During their breaks, they hang out in their studio, having sweetened cafe au lait in the unfinished "cafe" set.

Suji tells Bahar about the story behind his film. Bahar is slightly jealous of the girl who inspired Suji to write a screenplay, but does not let it show. She is happy to help him express his ideas, and tells Suji that she would make sure she wouldn't let Srikanth and Meghumi ruin the movie.

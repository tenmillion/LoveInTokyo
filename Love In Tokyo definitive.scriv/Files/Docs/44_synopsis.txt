[Song: “Tokyo Ren-ai Senka, Matawa Koi Wa Itte Mirya Bodi Buro” by Kenji Ozawa]

Suji and Aash are in a taxi together, on their way to his hostel in Harajuku. Aash has missed her last train to Machida.
Night lights fly past the taxi windows while an Ozaken song music plays on the midnight radio. Everything is picture-perfect. They kiss in the taxi.

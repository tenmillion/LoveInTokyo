Suji's career has not been off to a very successful start. He makes ends meet by doing random corporate commercials.
He has written a screenplay about a brief romantic encounter between an Indian politician and a Japanese starlet, based on his story with Aash, but set in the 60s.
He is not happy with it, and throws it in the trash while on business in Mumbai.
Srikanth, a Mumbai gang leader, finds the script and really likes it. He tracks Suji down and hires him to direct the movie with him and his Japanese lover Meghumi in the lead roles.
